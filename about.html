                    <p>
                        UAT is a private and family-owned University that merges the values of the traditional
                        academy with the modern technology campus, a fusion that enhances our ability to fulfill
                        the mission of educating students in the fields of advancing technology who innovate for our future.

                    <p>Learning at UAT extends from our students, staff and faculty to the institution itself. UAT's dedication to learning is
                        reflected in our efforts to create and develop new ways of learning that focus on the personal mission and vision of
                        every member of the UAT community. <br> <br>

                        UAT strives to foster knowledge creation and achieve academic excellence. We are at the forefront of developing academic
                        programs that tend to be unique among academia or emerge years ahead of other schools, such as Network Security and Robotics
                        and Embedded Systems, as well as our established Game Development majors that merged artistic and programming aspects long
                        before other colleges chose that focus for themselves.
